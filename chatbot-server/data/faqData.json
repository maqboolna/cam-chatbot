    "question": "What is the difference between CAM Institute of Design, and a generalist school?",
    "answer": "A generalist program is suitable for those interested in the design industry but unsure of what stream of design they are passionate about. However, students enrolling in a generalist program typically find they have to supplement their education with a specialised degree or certificate to build the specific skills needed for work. We understand that design studios are made up of specialised departments working together with each individual an expert in their field. Our instructors have more than two decades of experience and understand what skills are needed to prepare our students to be hired right after graduation. Our priority at CAM Institute of Design is to prepare students to enter the workforce masters of their chosen design branch."

    "question": "What level of experience and creative skills do I need to have to apply?",
    "answer": "Since all of our programs are structured to be project-based, we can modify students’ level of difficulty based on their past knowledge and experience. Our instructors are looking for students who are passionate, patient, and creative. Although we welcome all levels of experience, we do require students to have some basic knowledge of 3D or image manipulation. When deciding what projects to include in your portfolio, we suggest submitting the work you are the most proud of. Each element of your portfolio should be related to the program you’re applying to. For example, a student interested in UX/UI & Graphic Design should demonstrate their understanding of design fundamentals, attention to detail, knowledge of user-research, and passion."
